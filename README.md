## Introduction

This is the backend for the techNotes application. It is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It is deployed on Heroku and uses MongoDB Atlas for the database.

## Installation

To install this application, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. You will also need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=<your MongoDB Atlas URI>
PORT=<your desired port>
```
